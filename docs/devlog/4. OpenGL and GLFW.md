# OpenGL & GLFW
EasyX's **putpixel** is too slow, it takes about 1 second to render a 1000x1000 screen. Obviously it's unacceptable, thus I've chosen a more bottom-layer solution, using OpenGL to render.

As we know, OpenGL is a graphics API for GPU. However, I won't use advanced funcionality of it, just use it's immediate mode, to accomplish the last step of our soft rendering, putting caculated datas on the screen.
